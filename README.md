# WIP : WMN Track 3 Helper library

## Motivation

This work has been done in the field of python programming, by Shravan Kumar and Samvram Sahu, for the sole purpose of enriching and enhancing
the representation of the network/topology. Also, this can be applied in **Track 3** of the course **AV484 - Wireless Mesh
Networks**, taught at **Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology**.

## Usage

Read the code for a *still representation* with required comments [here](https://github.com/samvram/wmn_track3_helper/blob/master/script_for_team_2.py).

Read the code for a *flow simulation* [here](https://github.com/samvram/wmn_track3_helper/blob/master/script_for_team_2_Flow_Sim.py).

The results need some explanation:

* Red Spheres represent laptops running OLSRD
* Yellow Spheres represent Routers running OLSRD
* Green Sphere represents Sarath Sir
* All links are in White

## Results

The result is something in 3D which you can interactively see and visualize,
